## Modeling Compoundness

Morphological graph is aimed to capture the morphological relations between productive relations between Chinese characters (often itself serve as a single character) and words. The graph exclusive includes bi-syllabic words for two considerations: (1) Chinese words are predominantly bi-syllabic, which accounts for **(numbers here)**% word frequnecy in a corpus. (2) The morphological graph constructed in this search is to model how predictive a QIE compound is, including words longer than two characters potentially *peek* into the QIE compound structure. 

> describe morphological graph. Its vertices, edge number and include a sample figure. what's other index to describe a graph? raidus is hard to compute..!!

> define M-Vector here
To obtain a computaitonal representation of characters in morphological grpah, we employed node2vec() to compute a low-dimensional vector representation for each character. These vectors were called morphological vector (M-Vector) in this papaer.  

node2vec found a mapping $f: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$ from each vertices to a vector representation, and the mapping was optimized to maximize the log-probability of observing its neighbors in the network given the vector:

$$
\max_{f} \sum_{c\in\mathbb{C}}\log p(N(c)|f(c))
$$

We define $\mu_i = f(c_i)$ as the M-vector of character $i$ in the morphological graph.

$$
p(c_2 \mid c_1) =
    \frac{\exp\left(\phi(\mu_1, \mu_2)\right)}
    {\sum_{j \in \mathbb{C}} \exp\left(\phi(\mu_i, \mu_j)\right)}
$$

where $\phi(x, y)$ is cosine similarities between two vectors.

$$
p(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = \\
p(x_1) p(x_2 \mid x_1)\,p(x_3 \mid x_2)\,p(x_4 \mid x_3)
$$

## Modeling Compositioness

We define $\sigma_i$ as the sense vectors constructed from example sentences in CWN senses. Similarly, for each QIE in the analysis, we constructed $\sigma_q$ from sentences in corpus to construct contextualized embeddings.

$$
\sigma_i = \mathop{\bm{\mathrm{E}}}_{s\in\mathbb{S}}\left[\mathrm{BERT}(s)\cdot\delta(\mathrm{w_{\mathrm{target}}})\right]
$$

$$
\mathrm{compositioness} = \sum_{i \in QIE_x} 
$$
